# Understanding: index.html, style.css, and script-step2.js

- **index.html** – builds the page with an input box, a Submit button, and an output area.
- **style.css** – makes the layout neat and centered with some spacing and color.
- **script-step2.js** – adds behavior. When you click Submit, it shows “You entered: <your text>” in the output area.

**How they work together:**  
HTML gives the structure, CSS styles it, and JavaScript makes it interactive.
